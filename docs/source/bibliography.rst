FEniCS
######

The essential information about the FEniCS package, from the point of view of a user, is obtained in the book :cite:`LangtangenLogg2017`. If you want to get internal knowledge of FEniCS, refer to the monograph :cite:`LoggMardalEtAl2012` that treats extensively the subject of FEniCS implementation. In there, you can moreover find applications of FEniCS to a wide range of problems, including fluid flow, solid mechanics, electromagnetics, and geophysics.

Finite element method
#####################

Introduction to the method, solving techniques and applications in solid mechanics are covered in the book :cite:`braess_2007`. The essential reference for the theory of finite element method for elliptic problems is the exhaustive treatement :cite:`ciarlet2002finite`.


Mathematical theory of elasticity
#################################

The basic reference, which we also consulted about the theoretical aspects of our course, is the book :cite:`ciarlet1994three`.
